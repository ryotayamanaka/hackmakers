# Create and Enable a Graph User in SQLDeveloper Web

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to get started with SQL Developer Web. You will learn how to create a user in SQL Developer Web and provide that user the access to SQL Developer Web.

Estimated time: 3 minutes

### Objectives

- Learn how to create a database user in SQLDeveloperWeb.

### Prerequisites

* Oracle cloud account
* Provisioned Autonomous Database Shared Free Tier Instance

## **STEP 1:** Create the Customer_360 user

1. Login as the Admin user in SQLDevWeb of the newly created ADB Free Tier instance.

  Go to your Cloud Console, click **Autonomous Transaction Processing**. Select the ADB instance **ATP Graph** you created in Lab 2.

  In Autonomous Database Details page, click **Service Console**. Make sure your brower allow pop-up windows.

  Choose Development from the list on the left, then click the **SQL Developer Web**.

  Enter `ADMIN` as Username, and the enter the password you set up at Lab 2 Step 2, Section 7.

  Login as the ADMIN user.

2. Now create the `CUSTOMER_360` user. Enter the following commands into the SQL Worksheet and run it while connected as the Admin user.

  Note: Replace **<specify_a_password>** with a valid password string after copying and pasting the text below but **before executing** it in SQLDeveloperWeb.

    ```
    <copy>
    CREATE USER customer_360 
    IDENTIFIED BY <specify_a_password> 
    DEFAULT TABLESPACE data 
    TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp 
    QUOTA UNLIMITED ON data;  

    CREATE ROLE GRAPH_DEVELOPER;
    CREATE ROLE GRAPH_ADMINISTRATOR;

    GRANT connect, resource, graph_developer TO customer_360;
    </copy>
    ```

  ![](images/ADB_SDW_CreateUser_C360.png " ")

  *Notes:* 
  - *The `IDENTIFIED BY` clause specifies the password (i.e whatever you replaced <specify_a_password> with)*
  - *Since [20.3 the Graph Server uses database authentication](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/20/spgdg/using-inmemory-analyst-oracle-database.html). The user needs at least the graph_developer role.*

## **STEP 2:** Enable SQLDevWeb for Customer_360

1. Now provide SQLDevWeb access for this user. See the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/sql-developer-web.html#GUID-4B404CE3-C832-4089-B37A-ADE1036C7EEA)
  for details.

  First clear the previous text in the SQL Worksheet.

  Copy and paste the following text into the SQL Worksheet and run it.

    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
      ORDS_ADMIN.ENABLE_SCHEMA(
        p_enabled => TRUE,
        p_schema => 'CUSTOMER_360',
        p_url_mapping_type => 'BASE_PATH',
        p_url_mapping_pattern => 'c360',
        p_auto_rest_auth => TRUE
      );
      COMMIT;
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

  ![Enable SQLDevWeb for Customer_360](images/ADB_SDW_EnableLoginFor_C360.png " ")

  The URL for SQLDeveloperWeb for the Customer_360 user will have `c360` in place of `admin` in it.

  Save the URL for the next step.

  For details, see the ["Provide SQL Developer Web Access to Database Users"](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/sql-developer-web.html#GUID-4B404CE3-C832-4089-B37A-ADE1036C7EEA) section in the documentation.


  You may now proceed to the next lab.
